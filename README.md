### File Structure 📁

### Example Question 🏅

    Question: How many women competed in the 1924 Olympics?

Write a valid jq query using the dataset to get the expected output. The app compares your result to the expected answer.

`[.[] | select(.sex == "F" and .year == 1924)] | length`

### Customization 🛠️

Want to add your own questions?

Update questions.json with this format:
```json
{
  "question": "Your question here?",
  "expected_output": "Expected string result",
  "hint": "what command to run or thinkg about"
}
```

## Future Work 💡
